Char-Boy-Game
===============================
This game consist of a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
Below is the screenshoot of the game:

# Additional features to work on:
* Player selection: allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game.
* Score: to implement a score for the game. increase the score each time the player reaches the water, and reset it to 0 or reduced it when collision occurs.
* Collectables: add gems to the game, allowing the player to collect them to make the game more interesting.

Note: Anyone is invited to take part into this project.
